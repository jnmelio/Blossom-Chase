            <p id='instructions'>You are a florist who needs to catch pink cherry blossom petals to sell in his shop.  You have a little helicopter to do so. 
                <br> But beware of the clouds and dark petals. The dark petals will prevent you from catching the right amount of pink petals<br>
            and the clouds will cause your doom. You can use the up, down, left and right directions to evolve in this world. Once you start <br> 
            a timer of 2 min will be set. Collect 15 petals before the end of the timer or unleash chaos on the world.</p>

            <p id='gameOverText'>The florist could not get the petals and therefore did not make any money.<br> His wife left him for the food delivery 
                guy and his children disowned him cause delivery guy had a PS5. <br>Without money, Florist could not buy food and became homeless. <br> 
                One day he caught a pangolin and ate it. <br> He then became the first patient of Covid19.<br>
        Only because YOU could not catch some damn petals. <br>Hope you're happy!</p>
